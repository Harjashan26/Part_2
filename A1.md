Magoosh is an online test preparation for GRE. This app includes 1000 GRE words selected by magoosh experts. The words are divided into different sets which are common words and advanced words. Once you masters all the words in one set you move on to next set. When a word flashes on the screen you have to select whether you know the word or not, if not the definition of the word appears along with usage of the word in a sentence and the word goes to the reviewed section. After that the same word will repeat many times and if you click on I know the word every time it goes to the learning section and finally goes to the mastered section. The words keep on repeating on the screen until you learn all the words in that set and the person moves on to the next set of words. The words in the learning section repeated more frequently than the words in the mastered section. I choose this application because it is interesting and important. I used this app a year ago to prepare for GRE and it was very helpful. Instead of cramming the meaning of 5000 words you just have to learn these 1000 words which are very easy and fun to learn. GRE Flashcards is really an amazing app to learn words for the GRE exam. Even if you are not preparing for GRE you can use this app to improve your vocabulary in a very easy and interesting way. You can use it anytime while travelling, in breaks, while waiting in lines etc. Technologies leveraged in this app are Java, Xml, and Html5. The app is compatible with iOS 8.0 and above, iPhone, iPad and android. The App Type is Education. The strengths of the app are that it has different levels on the basis of difficulty of words. Also it uses very simple language to explain the word and also keeps the track of words you are learning. The weaknesses are that sometimes the words are repeated too often and it does not show the list of words in a deck. Possible improvements needed in this app are- Words should be repeated after a certain amount of time which will determine if the person has really learned the word or not. List of words in a deck should be given before going on to the learning part. In the end words from all the sets should be asked to see if one still remembers words from previous sets.

# First Heuristic Evaluation: _**Match between System and Real World**_
The language used is simple and easy. It explains the word in a very simple way with the help of a sentence. The app is very easy to use. You just have to tell whether to know the word or not, the app takes cares of the rest. You know that the words you hit as “I know this word” goes to learning and then to the mastered set. This app does follow the match between system and real world. The pattern followed by the app to learn words is simple as people use in their everyday life.

# Second Heuristic Evaluation: _**Consistency and Standards**_
GRE Flashcards follow the heuristic of Consistency and Standards. The pattern followed is same in all the decks of words. The word goes from reviewing to learning and then to mastered depending upon how many times to hit the button “I know this word”. It is followed in all the decks till the end.
